# Myfinalproject

Dear reader, I´m so happy to share with you this amazing project that I´ve been developing during the Wemanconnect bootcamp.

As you can see there are two main directory: 
#Client
In the client directory you will find all the front of my web application, I used React as a main technology. 
You can run the front application by simply :npm start 
#Server 
In the server directory you have in the index.ts file the connection to my database mysql and the commands used by the application, 
as you can see also I have the stage one from my project which involved the api with only a JSON as a data source ( I left this directory in case in the future I have a similar application).
You can run the back application by simply: npm run dev

It´s like a dream come true, to be developing finally a web! using all the thecnologies taught by the bootcamp. I hope you enjoyed as much as me.

Have a nice day 

Jessica
